# mysqlCode-C
C language database management system, used with database scripts (.sql).

I don't know why there is a trigger that restricts the gender to male or female that is always garbled, and needs to be manually adjusted after importing

When running,the exe file should be in the same directory as the libmysql .dll (placed in the x64/release directory) file
